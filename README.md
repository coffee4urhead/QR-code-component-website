# QR-code-component-website
This is a try-out coding challenge to the challenge i accapted in frontendmentor.io to try and figure out the design and structure provided within the challenge description.

[Found courage in:]
#@KevinPowell - the master of details using css from whom i learned the media queries and the details about it
#W3schools - the best website for documentation and description provided within just few simple clicks

[What is learned through this basic challenge]
-Learn the very basics of meadia queries and basic div centering and formatting used from me in the example i coded with the help i decribed at the top
-Learned the html semantic elements that help avoid the so called div soup which is nearly as spaghetti code

[What i will be working on]
-This was just the begging of developing a simple card-like style for a qr code. I want to be able to focus on making a fully working and fledged websites along my front-end journey from html and css to all the JavaScript front-end frameworks for animation and interactivity like next.js and three.js
